## Abstract
Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) has been proposed to stabilize global warming and limit the associated economic and societal consequences. A comprehensive assessment of the impacts of such an intervention is necessary to inform decision making regarding deployment. Here, we introduce a framework based on explainable artificial intelligence to quantify the impacts of SAI and of any geoengineering strategy. Our framework is advantageous in that it is purely data-driven, non-local, nonlinear, and also accounts for any epistemic or aleatoric uncertainties that might be present in the data. We find that SAI will likely have very diverse impacts on climate, e.g., decelerating changes for many variables like temperature, precipitation and extremes, while having negligible to no impact on e.g., ocean acidification. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding the potential impacts of geoengineering beyond mean-temperature or ensemble-mean responses and suggest the need for further research to fully assess the risks and benefits of such interventions.
